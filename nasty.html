		I'm on a journey to become a software engineer. It's a daunting journey because there's so much to learn. Too much, actually. Without a goal, it's possible to run around in circles chasing the "hot new thing." I fell into that trap, always reading about some exciting new development, but I realized I wasn't really developing a deep knowledge about any one subject, nor was I actually building anything. This blog is my attempt at developing new habits. So what is my goal? Broadly, I'd like to write software that solves problems. Specifically, I want to be able to build full-stack applications, and I want to develop competence in machine learning. Then I want to put those skills to use building tools that solve real problems.
