			I'm on a journey to become a software engineer. It's a daunting journey because there's so much to learn and there are hard problems in the domain. Without a goal, it's possible to spend all 	your time trying to keep up with the latest developments across the field, which moves at light	speed. I fell into that trap, always reading about some exciting new development, but I realized I wasn't developing deep knowledge about any one subject, nor was I actually building anything. This blog is my attempt at developing new habits and breaking out of that cycle.</p>
		<p>
			I want to be able to build full-stack applications, develop competence in machine learning, and learn computer science fundamentals: algorithms, computer architecture, parallel and distributed computing, operating systems, networks, and databases. I want to use those skills to build tools that matter.
